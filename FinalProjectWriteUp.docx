Image Gallery

The final app project that I will be working on is an image gallery app. In this app people can share there pictures, life experience, nature, memes and other picture related things.
This will be something like a social media in which but it will only focus on the photography skills. 

There will be following function in the app:-

1.User Login:- User can login into there account.
2.User Registration:- user can register then self to share the pictures.
3.View Picture:- Visitor can view the picture of the user without logging into the app.
4.Add picture:- user can share their pictures into the app after logging into the app.
5.Share picture:- user can share picture of a user to other users.
6.Like picture:- User can like a picture.
7.Favourite list:- user can add a picture to its Favourite list.
8.Follow user:- user can follow other user for the notifying there update.
9.Rate user:- user can rate fellow user to.
10.Recommendation :- Picture will be recommended according to interest of the user or the visitor

The above mention functionality can be implemented in ionic. The picture can be stored using the MongoDB database. The register and login can be implemented using the firefox database.

The app if feasible can be created in 8 weeks and final app will be a very small version of instagram but that will only be focusing on the photography.
